## How to Add Your Logo

Your logo image that you mentioned (logo png.png) needs to be added to the website.

### Steps:

1. **Locate your logo file** (the one with the green lotus and "EVA FAMILY RELAXATION SPA" text)

2. **Rename it to:** `logo.png`

3. **Place it in:** `/public/logo.png`

4. **Recommended specifications:**
   - Format: PNG with transparent background
   - Size: 200x200 pixels or larger (square aspect ratio works best)
   - File size: Under 500KB for optimal loading

### Current Status:
- A temporary placeholder logo is currently in place at `/public/logo.png`
- Once you replace it with your actual logo, it will automatically appear in:
  - Website header (top navigation)
  - Website footer
  - All pages across the site

### File Location:
Place your logo file at: `thatsspa/public/logo.png`

The logo will be displayed at approximately 64x64 pixels (4rem x 4rem) in the header and footer.
